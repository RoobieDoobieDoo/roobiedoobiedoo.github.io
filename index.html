    <p>Hey there! I’m Rubina Avetisyan, professional overthinker and full-time magnet for Murphy’s Law. If something can go wrong, there’s a 99% chance it’ll happen to me — and let’s be honest, that other 1% is probably just running late. I’m also studying International Relations and Development, which means I’ve learned how to navigate global conflicts… and my personal conflict with my Wi-Fi cutting out at the worst possible times.

I’ve always been fascinated by life’s little ironies, like how your toast will always land butter-side down or how the universe schedules every inconvenience right before a deadline. I guess you could say I’m the CEO of "Why Me?" moments!</p>
    
	<h3>Why I Made the Murphy's Law Page</h3>
    <p>I  made  this  page because, let’s face it, we’ve all been victims of Murphy’s Law. Whether you spill coffee on your white shirt five minutes before a big meeting, or you're running late only to get stuck behind the world’s slowest pedestrian parade, Murphy's Law loves to keep things interesting. So why not laugh about it?

This page is a tribute to life’s greatest mishaps — because sometimes you’ve just gotta throw your hands up, shrug, and say, "Well, of course that happened!" It’s a place to share your catastrophes, find humor in the chaos, and embrace the fact that things rarely go as planned.

If you’ve ever opened an umbrella to find it’s broken after the rain starts, or realized you hit 'Reply All' on that email (oops), you’re in the right place. Let’s laugh, cry, and wonder why the universe has such a weird sense of humor together!
